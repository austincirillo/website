<h3>Where are you from?</h3>

<p><img src="syracuse.png" alt="Syracuse" />I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing,_Michigan" target="_blank">Lansing Michigan</a>, but have lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York" target="_blank">Syracuse, New York</a>, ever since I was only a few months old.
I grew up becoming a huge fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse_Orange" target="_blank">Syracuse Orangemen</a>, our city's basketball team. Other than sports, Syracuse
is known for its crazy weather. We hit nationwide high snowfall levels every year. In fact, I just checked and we are <a href="https://www.niche.com/blog/top-25-snowiest-cities-in-america/" target="_blank">number 1</a>.</p>

<h3>Why Washington?</h3>

<p><img src="politics.png" alt="Politics" />Internships, internships, internships. I was not 100% committed to a career path coming out of high school.
I had interests in politics, history, writing, and so forth, but I had no specific goal. After applying to many schools,
I decided to attend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University" target="_blank">American University</a> because of its academic standing and perfect location in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." target="_blank">Washington, D.C.</a>
It turns out this was a great decision, because I have taken the opportunity to do several internships and have taken many
courses that have shifted my interests.</p>

<h3>Future goals?</h3>

<p><img src="sun.jpg" alt="Sun" />I am just about completed with my junior year of college. In the near future, I plan on attending graduate school if
the cost is not too high and if the univeristy I would attend seems worthwhile. Otherwise, I plan on joining the workforce
after narrowing down which internship I liked the best, and which tools from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_University" target="_blank">American University</a> I enjoyed learning the most.
In the long term after I am able to secure a job, I plan on moving somewhere warmer. Remember, I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_New_York" target="_blank">Syracuse</a>.</p>
